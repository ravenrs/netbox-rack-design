## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-24

### Release Summary
Initial release of NetBox Rack Design — a generic, public plugin that adds a
versioned **design layer** for planning rack changes on top of real NetBox data.
This first release delivers the data model and full management surface (Stage 1);
the interactive visual editor and apply/conflict/power features follow in later stages.

### Added
- **Models:** `Design` (versioned, sequenced, with dependencies and optional grouping),
  `DesignGroup` (hierarchical container), and `DesignPlacement` (add / move / remove
  actions, validated against `Rack.get_available_units()`).
- Full CRUD UI for all three models, including detail pages with related-object panels.
- REST API at `/api/plugins/rack-design/` (designs, design-groups, placements).
- GraphQL types and filters on the unified `/graphql` endpoint.
- Global search, navigation menu, change logging, journaling, custom fields, and tags.
- Config-driven statuses (`planned_statuses` / `removal_statuses` / `default_status`)
  via `PLUGINS_CONFIG` — nothing organization-specific is hardcoded.
- Test suite built on NetBox's standard test cases, plus MkDocs documentation.

2. Clear indicators for bugs, features, or enhancements
3. Bold "Breaking Changes" header when applicable with migration guidance
4. Detailed changelog with issue references
